# Scrypto DAO Challenge

What is a DAO?

> Decentralized Autonomous Organization

What are the fundamental components of a DAO?

- **Members** - You need members to have an organization so let's figure out what we can automate to make things awesome for those members.
- **Roles** - In order to operate you may need to have varying user roles to facilitate responsibilities, benefits, access control and authorization.
- **Voting** - Voting will be an important mechanism as this is an important way for your dao to make decisions. Although it might seem simple at first glance there are a lot of variables to think about here. Voting is likely an area where we could see a ton of innovation. This of course could couple tightly with roles or be designed in a manner which has no role requirement. You could allow members to delegate their votes to representatives or enforce strict pure 1 user 1 vote systems.
- **Treasury** - How will you manage finances, distribute earnings, pay expenses etc.
- **Governance** - How will your DAO operate? 100% vote on every action or elected representatives, or some combination of both.

With these four components in place you can begin to compose a world of possibilities that has only just begun to be explored.

In the following sections we will begin to build out the core functionality needed to facilitate a flexible DAO structure which can adapt to the particular project requirements.

As an example use case to help get us thinking about the possibilities as we build out the primary tools to get started I will use The Dev Path Community Driven Development project.
